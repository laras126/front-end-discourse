# Front-end Discourse

If you call yourself a front-end developer, then you're in the right place. 

### A call to action

This repository is a call to action for us, the front-end community, to come up with a set of community vetted and standardized job titles and descriptions. These will not only help us see how our individual skill-sets fit into the spectrum of front-end web development, but it can also help recruiters and hiring managers write job posts that attract more qualified candidates.

I'm hoping that in creating this repository, we can have a designated place to start a conversation that will ultimately result in evolving, community vetted front-end job titles and descriptions that are written by front-end developers, not recruiters.

### The issues

I am using the issues section of this repository to foster discussion. Scan through them, and if you have an opinion about one of them, let's hear it! And if you have an idea for an issue, post it! I've created some rough categories, but everything is up for interpretation and open to change.

Here are a few example issues:
- [There should be a standardized process for assessing technical skills](https://github.com/laras126/front-end-discourse/issues/4)
- [The term engineer is not appropriate for a front-end developer.](https://github.com/laras126/front-end-discourse/issues/3)
- [A front-end developer's skill-set lies on a spectrum within UI/UX <--> back-end](https://github.com/laras126/front-end-discourse/issues/2)

### Relevant reading

There has been a decent amount of dialog about these topics over the last few years. Here are a few links of note, and please add more as you please!

Some outlining of the problem:
* [Is there any value in people who cannot write JavaScript?](https://medium.com/@mandy.michael/is-there-any-value-in-people-who-cannot-write-javascript-d0a66b16de06)

### Thanks

Hi, I'm Lara. I'm a front-end developer that's a lot better at CSS than JavaScript. I am forever adjusting my job title in my Twitter bio, and I'd rather not.

Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for contributing!
