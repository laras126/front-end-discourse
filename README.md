### A Call to Action

This repository is a call to action for us, the front-end community, to come up with a set of community vetted and standardized job titles and descriptions. These will not only help us see how our individual skill-sets fit into the spectrum of front-end web development, but it can also help recruiters and hiring managers write job posts that attract more qualified candidates.

The fact of the matter is, most of us front-enders are <em>not</em> unicorns. We might be on our way to being unicorns, but as of now, the majority of us for hire have skills that lie end on one end of ()[the spectrum] or the other.

I'm hoping that in creating this repository, we can have a designated place to start this conversation.

### How this works

I am using the issues of this repository to foster discussion. So far the isssues mainly consist of hypothesis and prompts for discussion. Scan through the issues and if you have an opinion about one of them, let's hear it!

Here are a few examples:
### [Front-end developers can be plotted on a spectrum]

Here's what that looks like with me, Lara, plotted on it:

### Hypothesis: Front-end job titles are a problem


### Hypothesis: The term 'engineer' is not appropriate for a front-end developer
